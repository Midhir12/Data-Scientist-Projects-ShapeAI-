Hello everyone , I have enrolled myself in a Data Scientist Training and Internship Program at <b><a href="https://www.shapeai.tech/">Devtown (before - ShapeAI)</b></a> and the expected duration for the same will be 11 weeks long. Miss Khushboo Tayal , a Lead Data Analyst Trainer at ShapeAI is my mentor during this whole tenure. As this is a Virtual Training and Internship Program , I will be working from home.
<br><br>The Goal of this Industrial Training Program is to advance your programming skills and refine your ability to work with messy , complex datasets. You'll learn to manipulate and prepare data for analysis , and create visualisations for data exploration. Finally you'll learn your data skills to tell a story with the data. In this program you'll learn foundational data skills that apply across functions and industries. <br><br>You'll learn to analyse the data and build models with Excel, query databases using SQL, and create informative data visualisations with Python and it's libraries. All my internship projects are included in this repository collectively.
